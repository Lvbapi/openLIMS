# openLIMS

OpenLIMS is an open source Lab Information Management System. 
The basic idea behind OpenLIMS is to provide a system that works for anyone, without needing a dev team or expensive software. 

OpenLIMS was just born (June 2021), so any feedback is greatly appreciated! 

This software should be fully functional in its current state. 
However if you are looking to accomplish something else, please contact me and I will do my best to help!
